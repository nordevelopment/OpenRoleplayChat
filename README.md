# Open Roleplay Chat (ORC) 🤖🎭

> **The easiest way to chat, roleplay, and build AI agents on your own server. Clean, fast, and simple.**

ORC is a lightweight, beautiful web application for personal roleplaying and chatting with AI. You can create custom characters, give them unique personalities, and even let them write files or generate images for you.

## ✨ Features (Explained Simply)

- **🧠 Long-Term Memory**: Characters actually remember facts about you and the story. No more "forgetting" what you discussed 10 messages ago!
- **💬 Real-Time Chat**: Messages stream in word-by-word, just like talking to a real person.
- **🎭 Visual Character Catalog**: Easily add, edit, or delete characters directly from your browser. Upload custom avatars, write scenarios, and customize behavior without editing code.
- **🎨 AI Image Generator**: Ask the AI to paint a picture, or generate images manually with direct aspect ratio controls.
- **🛠️ AI Tools (Agents)**: Give characters the ability to create text files or paint pictures in a safe sandbox folder.
- **📱 Telegram Bot Support**: Talk to Natalia or your custom assistants right inside Telegram (optional setup).
